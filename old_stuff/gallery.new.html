      Firebird pilots should be careful with their weapons, otherwise they will have to use the incredible speed of the ship to flee their enemies.<br>
      An advantage is the stable hull design, using a special patented alloy no other ship can offer, which makes the Firebird very resistant to hostile weapon impact.</font></td>

      It can hold a massive amount of missiles, and has high-quality energy banks, yielding an incredible destructive force. Unfortunately its maneuverability is rather poor, which sometimes can make the ship hard to handle in a dogfight.<br>
      The lightning cannon was originally designed for this ship only, however soon after the Bluespire was released, all major spacecraft manufacturers have copied this weapon.</font></td>

Its extraordinary design is unique in the field of spacecraft engineering, and over time it has become a very popular ship. Actually it is pretty hard to get one these days, except on the black market.<br>
      Featuring an outstanding asymmetric hull design, the Cormoran has the best possible maneuverability.<br>
      However, due to the off-center location of the cockpit, it is not recommended for first-time spacecraft pilots.</font></td>

      Some time ago refurbished models of the Stingray were made available to the public, sporting an attractive price/performance ratio.<br>
      Its flat hull is pretty hard to crack, and the engines give some decent speed. The interior design is somewhat lacking, but this is compensated for by the cool military look.</font></td>

Incredibly low weight, streamlined hull, and two powerful thrust engines, make it suitable for a wide range of pilots. Except for those that like to have that extra missile loaded in case of emergency. There's not much space in a Claymore, but it is extra thin.<br>
      The first draft of this ship had extra wing extensions on the left and right, which were removed at a later design stage. The reasons for this decision are unknown, but it is rumored that some prototypes that were built had proved to be extremely unstable. </font></td>

However, its manufacturer and detailed specs are unknown.<br>
Due to its five propulsion drives it is rumored to be even a bit faster than the Firebird, but no unbiased information is available at this time.
In any case, this rumor and its looks have rapidly led to it becoming the most desired spacecraft for daring pilots and cut-throats.
It is also rumored to feature something called a gpu, a general plasma unit. What this actually refers to is still up to wild speculation, though.

Developed by some ominous military agency, unconfirmed reports state that its main purpose was to take out specific targets without being noticed at all. It seems to have played a key role in several armed conflicts over at least a decade. By now, Assassin sightings are reported at increasing frequency. This could be due to the fact that nowadays some brigands have been able to acquire this sophisticated craft, but are not familiar enough with its stealth technology.<br>
