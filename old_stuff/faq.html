   </table>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Parsec most of all is a fast-paced space shooter, where the emphasis is more on fun and action than on realism. As far as game play itself is concerned, Parsec has probably more in common with the network game play of first person shooters like Quake than with sophisticated simulations like Elite.<br>

   After starting up the game you simply choose a ship and select the galaxy you want to be playing in. You can do this in a number of ways. You can either select the desired galaxy in the starmap, enter stellar coordinates, choose a gameserver from a list of servers, or enter the DNS/IP address of a specific gameserver manually. (A gameserver directly corresponds to a galaxy in the Parsec universe.)<br>
   Every ship has some basic equipment right from the start, but to get most of the funky stuff like additional weapons, energy, invulnerability, and the like, you have to pick up power-ups that are floating around in outer-space. When you're shot down you lose most of them and are once again back down to the basic equipment. Other players can then reclaim the power-ups you've just lost.<br>
   The basic mode of game play is deathmatch, where you simply try to collect as many kills as possible. Basically, there are no explicit game sessions, players can join and leave a game at any time. However, it is possible to set kill and time limits on the server for specific solar systems, in order to determine the winner of a game after one of these limits has been reached.<br>
   We're currently thinking about team play modes, but there's nothing definitive on this issue yet.</font></p>

    </tr>
   </table>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Right now there is no plot in Parsec. There are no missions and no actual background story, just pure, fast-paced action. Nevertheless, we are considering setting Parsec in a scenario providing a motivating background. Whether this would include some sort of good guys and bad guys, or controlling ships of different human and alien races has not been decided yet.</font></p>

    </tr>
   </table>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">No, at least not in the foreseeable future. We have a lot of ideas that go much further than just deathmatch, or even more sophisticated team play modes, but due to our limited resources we have decided to focus on a certain subset of features, to avoid just talking cool stuff without ever living up to it. We know that many people would love to have features like trading, but for the time being we prefer to have a core concept that's actually within reach.</font></p>

     <td nosave><font face="Helvetica,Arial">4. What about a single-player mode then (bots)?</font></td>
    </tr>

   </table>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">We would love to include a single-player mode, but right now we are focusing exclusively on the multi-player aspect. Our resources are quite limited and it's already very hard to do a rock-solid multi-player game. On the other hand, we would really like to include bots you can use for honing your skills off-line. Like a lot of other features, bots will definitely have to wait until after the initial release, however. We intend Parsec to be an ongoing project, though, so there is lots of room for additional features.</font></p>

    </tr>
   </table>

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Right now we're supporting up to 16 players per solar system, but this number may increase in the future. This doesn't at all mean there are only 16 players in the entire game, however. Since a galaxy (gameserver) may be comprised of several solar systems, and the entire universe itself consists of all the gameservers, there may be many more people travelling the Parsec universe at any one time. The number of players per solar system is just the smallest unit of game play. As long as there are not already 16 players in a solar system, you can use a stargate to travel from system to system at any time. If a solar system is too crowded, the corresponding stargate will be closed and you won't be able to enter.</font></p>

    </tr>
   </table>
			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The possibility to found something like clans (or fleets) will definitely exist.<br>

   Alliances and more elobrate modes of game play will probably have to wait until after the initial release. However, we are considering several different team play modes right now. We have not really decided on any of these issues yet. First will be deathmatch-only, team play will follow later on.<br>
   Spacecraft will be piloted by one person only.</font></p>

   </table>

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The flight model of Parsec is very similar to Wing Commander's. It's intuitive and very easy to grasp. We really like physically-based flight models, though, so we would like to offer an alternative model in the future.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">The ping time will be displayed at the corresponding stargate, along with other useful information about the destination.

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Basically, you can talk at any time, although you may be shot down if you are connected to a particular solar system and have joined the battle. To avoid being shot, and giving others some cheap kills, you may choose to just stay connected to a solar system without joining the actual battle. In this state you are able to talk without risking to be blasted in the meantime.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial" size="2">Yes. Parsec will be highly configurable. You will be able to import your own ships, change textures, sounds, other data, etc.
      The entire Parsec source will be available from May 2003 on, and thus allow all kinds of extensions imaginable. The Parsec SDK that was planned previously will not be released as such, since it will be superseded by the full source release.</font></p>
