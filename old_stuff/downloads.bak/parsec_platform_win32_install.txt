
This is a release of the Win32-specific data of the Parsec LAN-Test build 0190.
It is meant for people who have a full release for another platform, but don't
want to download everything all over again for another platform. It does NOT
contain everything needed to run Parsec, an additional full release is required.

You have to install this release manually (create a Parsec folder wherever
you like, and put the files there, preserving the cons subfolder).
In order to complete the installation, you have to take the *.dat files from
a full release (pscdata0.dat, pscdata1.dat, and pscdata2.dat) and copy them
into your Parsec folder.

This should complete your installation.
Simply start launcher.exe to launch Parsec.

To verify the completeness of your installation, your Parsec folder should
contain the following files:

init.con            309 bytes
install.txt        1191 bytes
launcher.exe    1593344 bytes
parsec.exe       802816 bytes
pscdata0.dat   60730602 bytes
