This is a release of the MacOS-specific data of the Parsec LAN-Test build 0190.
It is meant for people who have a full release for another platform, but don't
want to download everything all over again for another platform. It does NOT
contain everything needed to run Parsec, an additional full release is required.

You have to install this release manually (create a "Parsec" folder wherever
you like, and put the files there, preserving the "cons" folder).
In order to complete the installation, you have to take the *.dat files from
a full release (pscdata0.dat, pscdata1.dat, and pscdata2.dat) and copy them
into your Parsec directory.

This should complete your installation.
Simply double-click the Parsec icon to launch Parsec.

To verify the completeness of your installation, your Parsec directory should
contain the following files:

init.con            341 bytes
Parsec          3023981 bytes
pscdata0.dat   60730602 bytes
pscdata1.dat     921608 bytes
pscdata2.dat   31547808 bytes
readme.txt        27789 bytes
cons:bindings.con   269 bytes
cons:user.con       322 bytes
