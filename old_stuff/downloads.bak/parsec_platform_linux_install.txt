This is a release of the Linux-specific data of the Parsec LAN-Test build 0190.
It is meant for people who have a full release for another platform, but don't
want to download everything all over again for another platform. It does NOT
contain everything needed to run Parsec, an additional full release is required.

You have to install this release manually (create a Parsec directory wherever
you like, and put the files there, preserving the cons/ subdirectory).
In order to complete the installation, you have to take the *.dat files from
a full release (pscdata0.dat, pscdata1.dat, and pscdata2.dat) and copy them
into your Parsec directory.

This should complete your installation.
Simply start ./launcher to launch Parsec.

To verify the completeness of your installation, your Parsec directory should
contain the following files:

init.con            341 bytes
INSTALL            1644 bytes
launcher        1015864 bytes
parsec_x        1125344 bytes
parsec_svga     1039440 bytes
pscdata0.dat   60730602 bytes
pscdata1.dat     921608 bytes
pscdata2.dat   31547808 bytes
README            27009 bytes
cons/bindings.con   269 bytes
cons/user.con       322 bytes

as well as the following symbolic links:

parsec       -> parsec_x
parsec.log   -> /tmp/parsec.log
parsecrc.con -> /tmp/parsecrc.con

If you want your installation of Parsec to be accessible to multiple users,
you can use or adapt the ./startparsec script. Install, for instance, in
/usr/games/parsec. You can then use the script (don't forget to set the
execute rights) to make a local version of parsecrc.con accessible to
Parsec, and copy it back again after exiting.
