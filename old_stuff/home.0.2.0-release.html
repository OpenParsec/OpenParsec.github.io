		Today is the 10th anniversary of the release of the Parsec code base by "The Fathers."   On March 29th
		in 2003, they created the SourceForge Project page and began the process of releasing the code to the world.<br /><br />

		It is my great pleasure to finally announce to the world, the first Internet based, playable version
		of OpenParsec ever to be released.  OpenParsec 0.2.0 was released to the world today at 11:00am EDT. 
		Although the game is very playble, this is still considered a beta release. For more information on 
		versioning, see the wiki page at 
		<a href="https://github.com/OpenParsec/openparsec/wiki/OpenParsec-Versioning">https://github.com/OpenParsec/openparsec/wiki/OpenParsec-Versioning</a>.<br /><br />
		To download the game, head over to the SourceForge Project page:
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/openparsec/">http://sourceforge.net/p/openparsec/</a>

		After a bit of contemplation, discussion, and bashing each other over the head, 
		the guys and I decided to move the source code repository to git.  The next
		obvious choice was to move the repository itself to github.com.  The issue 
		tracking as also moved there.<br /><br />
		<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OpenParsec/">https://github.com/OpenParsec</a><br /><br />
		This decision comes on the heels of some really great progress.  We're inching 
		closer to our first binary beta release, which the release itself will still occur
		on SourceForge.<br /><br />

		Keep an eye out, it's actually coming people...<br /><br />

		Nov. 2012 -- If you're reading this post, then you are seeing more progress in the making. 
		I've decided to move the Open Parsec website off of Source Forge and onto a more reliable   
		server.  I've also purchased a new domain name for the project.  If you came to us via 
		www.parsec.org, you may notice that your browser's address bar now says http://www.openparsec.com
		This is so that we can now make a distinction between the difference of the old Parsec LAN Demo 
		and Open Parsec, the Open Source Game. <br /><br />

		Phil, I, and several others have been making quite a bit of progress.  We have been
		having discusions in the #openparsec IRC channel on irc.slashnet.org for some time now.  
		Feel free to come and join us if you like.<br /><br />

		I'm also going to be cleaning this site up a bit and redirecting sections to the SourceForge
		pages, the Trac system, and more over the coming days.  Stay tuned for updates.<br /><br />

		And remember, "There Is No Safe Distance."<br /><br />

		Feb. 09, 2012 -- As I find myself writing this entry on openparsec.sourceforge.net, I can't believe 
		this is happening.  Nearly 9 years after the release of the source code by its original creators, 
		there are noticable things going on at the 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openparsec/">Source Forge Project page</a>.   I'm Jason, (AKA: Uber Linux Guy.)
		I've worked on the Open Parsec code off and on ever since the code was released.  And although I am
		not one of the original creators, I do have a passion to see this game complete. I had gone so far 
		as to spool up an SVN repository on my personal server along with a mailing list for anyone that wanted to help, 
		mostly because the SF Project page fizzled and the original creators all moved on to bigger and 
		better things. (And rightfully so.)<br /><br />
	
		Recently, after being away from the code for a couple of years again, due mostly to work, I 
		received an <a href="http://tulg.org/pipermail/openparsec/2012-January/000024.html">email</a>
		to the list on my personal server from Phil Spencer.  Phil's interest in the game and his email 
		inspired me to get back into things.  We've been twiddling with the code here and there for 
		about a month now, and after an email to the Open Parsec Fathers, they were kind enough to 
		allow me Project Admin rights to take up the reigns on the SF page.  <br /><br />

		Being someone who doesn't like to let others down, and now with the power to help make things happen, 
		I am making the call to all those developers out there who have stumbled across this work of gaming 
		art and always wanted to see it to completion.  Please join us on the 
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openparsec/">Source Forge Project page</a>, throw your development 
		skills into the ring, and let's see if we can get a fully functional Internet version of the game 
		out before the 10th anniversary of the Open Source Release of Parsec. <br /><br />

		And remember, "There Is No Safe Distance."<br /><br />
